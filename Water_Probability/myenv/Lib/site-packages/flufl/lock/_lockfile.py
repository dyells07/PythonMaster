class Lock:
    """Portable, NFS-safe file locking with timeouts for POSIX systems.

    This class implements an NFS-safe file-based locking algorithm
    influenced by the GNU/Linux open(2) manpage, under the description
    of the O_EXCL option:

        [...] O_EXCL is broken on NFS file systems, programs which rely on it
        for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.  The
        solution for performing atomic file locking using a lockfile is to
        create a unique file on the same fs (e.g., incorporating hostname and
        pid), use link(2) to make a link to the lockfile.  If link() returns
        0, the lock is successful.  Otherwise, use stat(2) on the unique file
        to check if its link count has increased to 2, in which case the lock
        is also successful.

    The assumption made here is that there will be no *outside interference*,
    e.g. no agent external to this code will ever link() to the specific lock
    files used.

    The user specifies a *lock file* in the constructor of this class.  This
    is whatever file system path the user wants to coordinate locks on.  When
    a process attempts to acquire a lock, it first writes a *claim file* which
    contains unique details about the lock being acquired (e.g. the lock file
    name, the hostname, the pid of the process, and a random integer).  Then
    it attempts to create a hard link from the claim file to the lock file.
    If no other process has the lock, this hard link succeeds and the process
    accquires the lock.  If another process already has the lock, the hard
    link will fail and the lock will not be acquired.  What happens in this
    and other error conditions are described in the more detailed
    documentation.

    Lock objects support lock-breaking so that you can't wedge a process
    forever.  This is especially helpful in a web environment, but may
    not be appropriate for all applications.

    Locks have a ``lifetime``, which is the maximum length of time the
    process expects to retain the lock.  It is important to pick a good
    number here because other processes will not break an existing lock
    until the expected lifetime has expired.  Too long and other
    processes will hang; too short and you'll end up trampling on
    existing process locks -- and possibly corrupting data.  However
    locks also support extending a lock's lifetime.  In a distributed
    (NFS) environment, you also need to make sure that your clocks are
    properly synchronized.

    Each process laying claim to this resource lock will create their own
    temporary lock file based on the path specified.  An optional lifetime
    is the length of time that the process expects to hold the lock.

    :param lockfile: The full path to the lock file.
    :param lifetime: The expected maximum lifetime of the lock, as a
        timedelta or integer number of seconds, relative to now.  Defaults
        to 15 seconds.
    :param separator: The separator character to use in the lock file's
        file name.  Defaults to the vertical bar (`|`) on POSIX systems
        and caret (`^`) on Windows.
    :param default_timeout: Default timeout for approximately how long the lock
        acquisition attempt should be made. The value given in the `.lock()`
        call always overrides this.
